#+Title: lhs.hpp
#+Call: Setup()
#+Call: HomeUp()

* Motivation

This file define =XXX_LHS= like classes that are useful to declar left hand side. By example:

#+begin_src cpp :eval never
V = V + a * W
#+end_src

can be (por must be, if you care about performance) rewritten as:
#+begin_src cpp :eval never
V = lhs(V) + a * W
#+end_src

- Note :: it would have been better to be able to write something like
#+begin_src cpp :eval never
V = lhs + a * W
#+end_src
however that's not possible as we use =V= information like =size= and
=element_type= to construct the =Vector_LHS= class

* Implementation

** The =lhs()= function                                                  :User:
#+Index:Function!lhs

This is the function the user must use. It returns a [[id:a3688737-7c97-4f22-8221-d00af7247898][The =Vector_LHS=]]
or [[id:a3688737-7c97-4f22-8221-d00af7247898][The =Matrix_LHS=]].

#+Call: Extract("lhs.hpp","lhs")

*** Usage example

A blas like expression

\begin{equation*}
M=\alpha M_1 M_2 + \beta M
\end{equation*}

must be written as:

#+begin_src cpp :eval never
M = a * M1 * M2+ b * rhs(M)
#+end_src

** The =Vector_LHS=                                                       :Dev:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       a3688737-7c97-4f22-8221-d00af7247898
   :END:

# file:lhs.hpp::BEGIN_Vector_LHS
#+Call: Extract("lhs.hpp","Vector_LHS")

** The =Matrix_LHS=                                                       :Dev:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       a3688737-7c97-4f22-8221-d00af7247898
