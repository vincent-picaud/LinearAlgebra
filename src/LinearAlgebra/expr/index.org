This directory define low-level API to call computational subroutines. By "low-level" we means that calls are performed by flat function calls

#+begin_src cpp
assign(V, V, _plus_ 2, W);
#+end_src

and not by an expression template mechanism that would allow us to write:
#+begin_src cpp
V = V + 2 * W;
#+end_src

The first steps are to introduce a [[id:5e5dd322-57cf-4297-b1e2-ccf147f4adc3][Base class for VMT (vectors, matrices, tensors...)]] and some tags

* Design
